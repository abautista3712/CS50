## Description

Jetpack Joyride is a game developed in LÖVE2D that is largely inspired by the once-viral mobile app Flappy Bird. The game follows an astronaut lost in space and who is trying to use a jetpack to navigate through an asteroid belt. Custom drawn sprites were made by myself using the free online editor piskel (https://www.piskelapp.com/). Sound effects were generated through sfxr (https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) all other music credits can be found below.
