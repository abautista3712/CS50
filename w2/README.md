# Problem Set 2

For this problem set, you’ll use CS50 IDE, a cloud-based programming environment.

## What to Do

1. Go to ide.cs50.io and click “Sign in with GitHub” to access your CS50 IDE.
2. Submit [Readability](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/readability/)
3. Submit one of:
   - [Caesar](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/caesar/) if feeling less comfortable
   - [Substitution](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/substitution/) if feeling more comfortable

If you submit both Caesar and Substitution, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.
